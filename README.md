# Compiler-Design-Lab
CSL411 COMPILER LAB KTU S7 2019 SCHEME

Preamble: This course aims to offer students hands-on experience on compiler design
concepts. Students will be able to familiarize with tools such as LEX and YACC and
automate different phases of a compiler. This course helps the learners to enhance the
capability to design and implement a compiler.

Prerequisite: A sound knowledge in C programming, Data Structures, Formal languages and
Automata Theory and Compiler design.

Course Outcomes: After the completion of the course the student will be able to

CO 1 
Implement lexical analyzer using the tool LEX. (Cognitive Knowledge Level:
Apply)

CO 2 
Implement Syntax analyzer using the tool YACC. (Cognitive Knowledge Level:
Apply)

CO 3 
Design NFA and DFA for a problem and write programs to perform operations on it.
(Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)

CO 4 
Design and Implement Top-Down parsers. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)

CO 5 
Design and Implement Bottom-Up parsers. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)

CO 6 
Implement intermediate code for expressions. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
